# 🧠 Project-Jarses – Real-World J.A.R.V.I.S. Assistant

**Project-Jarses** is the open-source foundation of an ambitious mission to build a real-world AI assistant and intelligent modular exosuit, inspired by Tony Stark’s J.A.R.V.I.S. Built under **Jarses Industries**, this system integrates AI, voice recognition, robotics, AR/VR, and IoT control – designed for both **civilian** and **defense** applications.

## 🔧 Core Features

- 🎙️ **Voice Command System**  
  Real-time speech recognition and TTS via Python, Hugging Face models, and `gTTS`.

- 🧠 **Natural Language Processing**  
  Smart conversation using Hugging Face’s DeepSeek-V3 (or interchangeable OpenAI support).

- 💬 **Basic Command Understanding**  
  Executes simple system commands, speaks responses, and remembers context.

- 💾 **Short-Term Memory** *(Work in Progress)*  
  Planned: Store session data in memory for context-awareness.

- 🕹️ **IoT/Hardware Control** *(Work in Progress)*  
  Raspberry Pi & Arduino integration for home/robotic device control.

- 🧬 **Health Monitoring** *(Planned)*  
  Track vitals, stress, and motion via sensors (ECG, EMG, temp).

- 🕶️ **AR/VR Interface** *(Planned)*  
  Unity/WebXR HUD for command feedback and holographic data.

- ⚙️ **Simulation Support** *(Planned)*  
  Integration with CAD & Unity to simulate AI–suit interaction before hardware deployment.
