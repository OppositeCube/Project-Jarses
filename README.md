# Project-Jarses
Real-world J.A.R.V.I.S.-style AI assistant with voice command, NLP, IoT integration, and modular exosuit compatibility. Part of the Jarses Industries initiative.
# Jarses AI – Real-World J.A.R.V.I.S. Assistant

Welcome to **Jarses AI**, the open-source foundation of an ambitious mission to build a real-world AI assistant and intelligent modular exosuit, inspired by Tony Stark’s J.A.R.V.I.S. Built under **Jarses Industries**, this system integrates AI, voice recognition, robotics, AR/VR, and IoT control – all designed for both **civilian** and **military** applications.

## 🔧 Core Features

- 🎙️ **Voice Command System** – Real-time voice recognition and response using `speech_recognition`, `gTTS`, and Hugging Face models.
- 🧠 **Natural Language Processing** – Smart AI replies using `DialoGPT` or OpenAI-based models.
- 🕹️ **IoT/Hardware Control** – Extendable to sensors, motors, smart devices, and basic robotics using `Raspberry Pi` or `Arduino`.
- 🧬 **Health Monitoring (Future)** – Track vitals, motion, and stress levels via sensors (ECG/EMG, temperature, etc.).
- 🕶️ **AR/VR Interface (Planned)** – Unity or WebXR-based HUD for command feedback, data overlay, and holographic interaction.
- 🔐 **Memory System** – Short-term and long-term memory handling using JSON/YAML storage.
- ⚙️ **Simulation Support** – CAD + Unity environment integration to simulate AI-suit interactions before hardware deployment.
